# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī phonetics are consistent. You can access a dictionary [here](https://gist.github.com/LilyAsFlora/b89e47fe391010c54a54462f0f354cd0).

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. As a Polish speaker, Rirī originally included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) to add variety from English. I removed them later due to their unaesthetic sounds.

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system.

|            | Front | Near-front | Central | Near-back | Back  |

| Close      | i, i: |            |         |           | u, u: |
| Near-close |       |            |         |           |       |
| Close-mid  |       |            |         |           |       |

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables, using a pattern of **(C)(C)V(C)**.

General constraints:

- All syllables have a nucleus
- Maximum 1 coda
- Only nasals and unvoiced consonants in codas (excluding /h/)
- Maximum of 2 consonants in onset
- Only liquids in secondary onset consonants
- No consonantal clusters joining liquids and fricatives
- Complex onsets cannot cluster obstruents & sonorants together

### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables to induce the effect of a rhythmic meter.

## Syntax

### Word Order

Generally, Rirī uses a default word order of SVO (subject-verb-object). This may be changed for poetic effect. Possessors and adjectives may come before or after the noun they modify, whereas adpositions and auxiliary verbs usually precede. 

_Ema vidum mam wariua._ — She saw the small sign.

_Waruia mam vidum ema._ — _lit._ The sign small saw she. (same meaning as above)

## Grammar

### Plurality

Singular nouns are unmarked. Plurals are marked with suffixes -i or -ī, depending on the noun's ending.

- If the noun ends with a consonant, the suffix -i is appended
- If the noun ends with a vowel, the vowel is replaced with the suffix -i
- If the noun ends with -i, it is replaced with the suffix -ī

_Sa rīum shosen._ — I read (a) poem (out loud).

_Sa rīum shoseni._ — I read poems (out loud).

### Tense

Rirī includes four basic tenses: past, present, future, and conditional. These are expressed with affixation and auxiliary verbs. 

_Ema nenu kronue dwukro._ — She must have waited for a while.

|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
|        past: suffix -m       |    _sa kronum_ — I waited    |     _sa okronum_ — I was waiting    |      _sa kronume_ — I had waited     |      _sa okronume_ — I had been waiting     |
|       present: unmarked      |      _sa kronu_ — I wait     |     _sa okronu_ — I have waited     |      _sa kronue_ — I have waited     |      _sa okronue_ — I have been waiting     |
|      future: suffix -sh      |  _sa kronush_ — I will wait  |  _sa okronushe_ — I will be waiting |  _sa kronushe_ — I will have waited  |  _sa okronushe_ — I will have been waiting  |
| conditional: + chū, nenu, etc| _sa chū kronu_ — I would wait| _sa chū okronu_ — I would be waiting| _sa chū kronue_ — I would have waited| _sa chū okronue_ — I would have been waiting |

### Noun Cases

Rirī features two marked cases: possessive and instrumental, indicated with suffixes. For vowel-final nouns, endings are replaced with the given inflection's beginning vowel (if one exists).

The following table shows inflection for consonant-final nouns:

|              | Singular | Plural   | Example                                                                    |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
