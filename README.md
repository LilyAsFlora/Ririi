# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī phonetics are consistent, 

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. As a Polish speaker, Rirī originally included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) to add variety from English. I removed them later due to their unaesthetic sounds.

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables, using a pattern of **(C)(C)V(C)**.

General constraints:

- All syllables have a nucleus
- Maximum 1 coda
- Only nasals and unvoiced plosives & affricates in codas
- Maximum of 2 consonants in onset
- Only liquids in secondary onset consonants
- No consonantal clusters joining liquids and fricatives
- The first consonant in a complex onset must be an obstruent

### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables to induce the effect of a rhythmic meter.

## Syntax

### Word Order

Generally, Rirī uses a default word order of SVO (subject-verb-object). This may be changed for poetic effect. Possessors and adjectives may come before or after the noun they modify, whereas adpositions and auxiliary verbs usually precede. 

_Ema vidum mam wariua._ — She saw the small sign.

_Waruia mam vidum ema._ — _lit._ The sign small saw she. (same meaning as above)

## Grammar

### Plurality

Singular nouns are unmarked. Plurals are marked with suffixes -i or -ī, depending on the noun's ending.

- If the noun ends with a consonant, the suffix -i is appended
- If the noun ends with a vowel, the vowel is replaced with the suffix -i
- If the noun ends with -i, it is replaced with the suffix -ī

_Sa rīum shosen._ — I read (a) poem (out loud).

_Sa rīum shoseni._ — I read poems (out loud).

### Tense

Rirī includes four basic tenses: past, present, future, and conditional. These are expressed with affixation and auxiliary verbs.

|                              |       simple: unmarked       |        continuous: prefix o-        |          perfect: suffix -e          |   perfect continuous: prefix o-, suffix -e  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
|        past: suffix -m       |    _sa kronum_ — I waited    |     _sa okronum_ — I was waiting    |      _sa kronume_ — I had waited     |      _sa okronume_ — I had been waiting     |
|       present: unmarked      |      _sa kronu_ — I wait     |     _sa okronu_ — I have waited     |      _sa kronue_ — I have waited     |      _sa okronue_ — I have been waiting     |
|      future: suffix -sh      |  _sa kronush_ — I will wait  |  _sa okronushe_ — I will be waiting |  _sa kronushe_ — I will have waited  |  _sa okronushe_ — I will have been waiting  |
| conditional: + chū, nenu, etc| _sa chū kronu_ — I would wait| _sa chū okronu_ — I would be waiting| _sa chū kronue_ — I would have waited| _sa chū okronue_ — I would have been waiting |
