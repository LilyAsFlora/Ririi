# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī phonetics are consistent, 

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. As a Polish speaker, Rirī originally included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) to add variety from English. I removed them later due to their unaesthetic sounds.

## Phonotactics

### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables.

General constraints:

- The maximum number of codas in any given syllable is 1.
- Codas may only feature nasals and unvoiced plosives & affricates.

### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables to induce the effect of a rhythmic meter.
