# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī is inflected and phonetically consistent. You can access a dictionary [here](https://github.com/LilyAsFlora/Ririi/blob/master/dict.md).

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. As a Polish speaker, I originally included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) for variety. I removed them later because I decided they sound too harsh for a soft-spoken language.

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system.

|            | Front | Near-front | Central | Near-back | Back  |
|------------|-------|------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Close      | i, i: |            |         |           | u, u: |
| Near-close |       |            |         |           |       |
| Close-mid  |       |            |         |           |       |
| Mid        | e, e: |            |         |           |       |
| Open-mid   |       |            |         |           | o, o: |
| Near-open  |       |            |         |           |       |
| Open       |       |            | a, a:   |           |       |

### Phonotactics

#### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables: **(C)(C)V(C)**, though open syllables are more common.

General constraints:

- Only nasals, unvoiced consonants and non-glottals in codas
- If the first consonant in a complex onset is a nasal, the second cannot be /w/
- Obstruents can only cluster with sonorants
- The first consonant in a complex onset must be an obstruent (e.g. disallowing mra)

#### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of accents to evoke a rhythmic [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). Such a system is useful because it allows singers to freely emphasise syllables that land on strong beats.

## Syntax

### Word Order

Rirī has a de facto word order of SVO (subject-verb-object), but this can change for poetic effect. Possessors and adjectives may come before or after the noun they modify, whereas adpositions and auxiliary verbs precede. 

## Grammar

### Personal Pronouns

Rirī includes the universal first, second, and third person pronouns. Notice the distinction between plural and singular _they_. _Emi_ is used in reference to groups with one or more masculine entities. _Emai_ is used in reference to groups of strictly feminine entities. If ambiguous, _amī_ may be used.

#### Singular

| Person | Subject                  | Object                        |   
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | _sa_ — I                 | _sām_ — me                    |   
| 2      | _chi_ — you               | _cham_ — you                   |   
| 3      | _em/ema/ano/ami_ — he/she/it/they | _emam/emām_/anam/amam — him/her/it/they |   

#### Plural

| Person | Subject      | Object         |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| 1      | _sai_ — we   | _saī_ — me   |
| 2      | _cī_ — you   | _cīm_ — you   |
| 3      | _emi (m.) / emai (f.)_ — they | _emiam (m.) / emaiam (f.)_ — them |

### Plurality

Singular nouns are unmarked. Plurals are marked with suffixes -i or -ī, depending on the noun's ending.

- If the noun ends with a consonant, the suffix -i is appended
- If the noun ends with a vowel, the vowel is replaced with the suffix -i
- If the noun ends with -i, it is replaced with the suffix -ī
- If the noun already ends with -ī, it can be left alone. Optionally, plurality can be enforced with an auxiliary word (e.g. an adjective meaning "many").

### Verbs

Verb conjugation depends on suffixes, particles, and auxiliary verbs. Regular verbs follow this order of conjugaton:

1. Aspect
2. Person
3. Number
4. Tense

Causativity can be described with the verb *miku* (to give), with the action that is caused in the infinitive, and the causee in the accusative.

*Mikun kronu cham.* I made you wait.

Passive actions are indicated with the particle *do* (from *dolu*, "to come").

*Han hali.* The wind blows.

*Han do hali.* The wind is blown.

#### Number

Singular: (unmarked)

Plural: suffix *e*

#### Person

1st person: (unmarked)

2nd person: suffix *la*

3rd person: suffix *li*

#### Tense

Present: unmarked

Past: suffix *n*

Future: suffix *ta*

#### Aspect

Simple: unmarked

Continuous: particle *li*

Perfect continuous: particle *le*

#### Mood

Indicated by auxiliary verbss.

### Noun Case

Rirī features three marked cases: possessive, instrumental, and accusative. They are indicated with suffixes. Note the following:

1. If simply pasting an affix onto a word results in joined vowels, the affix's vowel always replacs the word's vowel. If the word's vowel is long, this vowel is shortened and joined to the affix. 

2. If clustered obstruents or sonorants occur, the affix replaces the noun's consonant.

3. If the final syllable of a word and the affix have matching rimes, the affix replaces the syllable. To illustrate: the possessive case of *madora* ("dream") is *madola*, not *madorala*.

|              | Singular | Plural    | 
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Possessive   | n. + -la | n. + -li |              
| Instrumental | n. + -chu | n. + -chi | 
| Accusative   | n. + -am  | n. + -mi |

### Adjectives

Adjectives take three standard forms: positive, comparative, and superlative. Adjectives must use the ending _-e_ when describing plural nouns. 

| Positive: unmarked            | Comparative: suffix *ē*                 | Superlative: suffix *u*                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| _eli_ — clean   | _elē_ — cleaner     | _elu_ — cleanest      |
| _rīuch_ — talkative | _rīuchhu_ — more talkative | _rīuchshe_ — most talkative |

### Yes-no Questions

To form yes-no questions, particles _chī_, _chou_ and _chao_ may be applied at the beginning of a sentence.  _Chi_ can also be used as "or."

#### Chaī: neutral

#### Chou: expecting "yes"

#### Chao: expecting "no"

### Negation

To negative a sentence, add particle _ja_ (lit. "no") before the verb.

### Conjunctions

Conjunctions have the addition of distinguishment between exclusive and inclusive.

_X chi Y_ means you may have X or Y or both. 

_Chi X chi Y_ means you can have only either X or Y, not both.
