Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (artlang) designed for poetry, song, diaries, or other artistic expression. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī is agglutinative and phonetically consistent. You can access a dictionary [here](https://github.com/LilyAsFlora/Ririi/blob/master/dictionary.md).

## Phonology

Given its purpose, Rirī's phonology suits simply what I consider euphonious, being loosely influenced by Latin and Japanese. As a Polish speaker, the consonant set originally included both retroflex affricates and fricatives, before I decided they sound too harsh for a soft-spoken language. Thus, delicate consonants like /l/, /ɾ/, nasals, and close/mid vowels tend to appear most frequently in the lexicon, particularly in comparison to voiced plosives. 

Consonants are never aspirated.

### Consonants

|                     | Bilabial | Labiodental | Alveolar | Postalveolar |Palatal| Velar | Glottal |
|:-------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:-:|:-----:|:-------:|
|       Plosive       |   p, b   |             |   t, d   |              ||  k, g |         |
|        Nasal        |     m    |             |     n    |              ||       |         |
|     Tap or flap     |          |             |     ɾ    |              ||       |         |
|      Fricative      |          |      v      |   s, z   |             |ç|       |    h    |
|     Approximant     |          |             |          |       l      ||   w   |         |
|      Affricate      |          |             |          |     t͡ɕ,  d͡ʑ   ||       |         |

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system.

- /e/ is the open-mid front unrounded vowel [ɛ]
- /u/ is the close back unrounded vowel [ɯ]

|            | Front | Central | Back  |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Close      | i, i: |         | u, u: |
| Mid        | e, e: |         |       |
| Open       |       | a, a:   | ɒ, ɒ: |

## Phonotactics

### Syllable shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables according to **(C)(H)V(X)** where:

- (H) denotes an approximant or a liquid
- (X) denotes nasals and unvoiced consonants, excluding /h/

Additionally,

- No obstruent-obstruent clusters may occur (even across syllables).

Note that although Rirī permits closed and open syllables, the former is much less common.

### Stress

Rirī lacks a strict lexical stress. Instead, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of accents to evoke a rhythmic 
[meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). Such a system allows singers to freely emphasise 
syllables that land on strong beats.

## Word Order

Rirī is primarily head-final. The following orders are typical but can be altered for poetic effect.

- subject - object - verb 
- adjective - noun
- adverb - verb
- adverb - adjective

## Verbs

All infinitives end with a syllable containing a consonant followed by -u. Verb roots do not include this syllable.

Verbs should be conjugated according to the following pattern:
- [aspect particle] verb root + person suffix + number suffix + tense suffix + mood suffix

| subjunctive | -de       |

### Causativity

To indicate a causative action:
- Introduce the auxiliary verb *miku* (to give) before the action verb, with the verb in the infinitive and the receiver in the accusative.

Passive actions can be indicated with the particle *cho* before the verb.

## Personal Pronouns

Rirī includes the gender-distinguished first, second, and third person pronouns. 
Notice the distinction between plural and singular _they_. 
One should use _emi_ in reference to groups with one or more masculine entities, and _emī_ for groups of strictly feminine entities. 
If ambiguous, inanimate or otherwise neuter, _amī_ is an option.

| Person | Singular                  | Plural                        |   
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | _sa_ — I                 | _si_ — we                   |   
| 2      | _cha_ — you               | _chi_ — you                   |   
| 3      | _em/ema/ano/ami_ — he/she/it/they | _emi/emī_/ani/amī- — they (m.) / they (f.) /it/they |

## Nouns

### Case

Rirī has four cases, which are distinguished by suffixes.

When applying a suffix:
- If the noun ends with a consonant, remove it, then apply the suffix.
- If the noun ends with two vowels, remove the final vowel, then apply the suffix.

Note that the noun complement of *lu* ("to be") should be in the instrumental case.

|                  | **singular** | **plural** |
|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **genitive**     | -la          | -li        |
| **instrumental** | -chu         | -chi       |
| **accusative**   | -ma          | -mi        |
| **vocative**     | -shi         | -shī       |

### Plurality

Plurality is also indicated with suffixes.

| **noun ending**     | **suffix**                  |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| (any consonant) | -i                      |
| (any vowel)     | (replace vowel with -i) |
| -i              | -ī                      |
| -ī              |            -            |

## Subclauses

All relative clauses should take the same tense as the main clause.

### Nominal and adjective

- Nominal clauses are unmarked.

- To form an adjective clause, turn the phrase into a nominal clause and introduce the particle *do*.

### Adverbial clauses

All adverbial clauses are indicated with conjunctions.

| **CLAUSE TYPE** | **CONJUNCTION** |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| time            | _kē_ ("when")       |
| place           | _kū_ ("where)      |
| manner          | _gā_ ("which")      |
| reason          | _sō_ ("what")       |
| purpose         | _shī_ ("because")   |
| condition       | _nē_ ("if")         |
| concession      | _mō_ ("but")        |

## Adjectives

### Agreement

Adjectives derive from nouns. They agree in case and number by suffixes.

When applying a suffix:
- If the adjective ends with a vowel, remove the vowel, then apply the suffix.
- If the noun the adjective describes is plural, append -i onto the suffix.

| **CASE**     | **SUFFIX** |
|--------------|------------|
| (unmarked)   |      -     |
| genitive     | -a         |
| instrumental | -u         |
| accusative   | -e         |
| vocative     | -o         |

### Degree

- To form a comparative adjective, reduplicate the first syllable.
- To form a superlative adjective, reduplicate the final syllable.

## Gradation

Rirī offers several ways to apply diminution and augmentation.

### Diminishing nouns

- If the noun ends with two vowels, you can add *sh* or *ch* before the final vowel.
- If the noun ends with a consonant followed by a vowel, you can replace the consonant with *sh* or *ch*.
- If the noun ends with a sonorant consonant, you can apply *-shi* or *-chi* as a suffix.
- If the noun ends with an obstruent, you can apply *shi* or *chi* before it.

### Augmenting nouns

- If the noun ends with two vowels, you can add *z* before the final vowel.
- If the noun ends with a consonant followed by a vowel, you can replace the consonant with *z*.
- If the noun ends with a sonorant consonant, you can apply *-zi* as a suffix.
- If the noun ends with an obstruent, you can apply *zi* before it.

| **EXAMPLE** | **DIMINISHED** | **AUGMENTED** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| maria       | marisha        | mariza        |
| madora      | madosha        | madoza        |
| moshin      | moshinshi      | moshinzi      |

## Musical Features

Rirī provides a set of monosyllabic "rhyme particles" that lack lexical semantics but aid in the evocation of tone, rhythm, consonance and assonance. One can construct these using any of the following consonants, followed by a vowel of the speaker's choosing, and an optional coda.

|Consonant|b p|m n|l r|k g|w|v|s z|ch j|t d|sh|h|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
|Meaning|joy, serenity|sorrow, pain|trust, hope|doubt, fear|surprise, curiosity|disgust|anger, impatience|anticipation|weakening of meaning|strengthening of meaning|(no mood)|

To illustrate: the particles *da ma* can serve two purposes:
- Evoking sorrow (as indicating by *m*) of a weak nature (as indicated by *d*),  
- Creating a rhyme with nearby syllables that include *a*

Note that this would hold the same in reverse order (*ma da*).

One can combine these particles to create more complex meanings. Using *ve* and *tu* together, for example, mixes disgust and anger to create contempt. Placing one at the beginning of a sentence, and one at the end, could imply a change in mood, or that the speaker is ambivalent in their emotion. Nevertheless, this tool has most use in song: particles could emphasise certain beats, fill space not taken by other words, and as aforementioned, offer rhyme and alliteration.

In romanisation, one should hyphenate these particles.

## Derivational Morphology

The following unbound morphemes can be applied as suffixes and affixes.

### Affixation rules: suffixes

- If the body ends with a vowel, and the affix begins with a vowel, remove the body's final vowel.
- If the body begins with a consonant followed by a vowel, and the affix begins with a consonant, remove the body's final consonant and vowel.

Otherwise, simply apply the suffix.

### Affixation rules: prefixes

- If the body begins with an obstruent and the affix ends with an obstruent, add -u- between the affix and the body.
- If the prefix ends with a vowel and the body begins with a vowel, remove the prefix's final vowel.

Otherwise, simply apply the prefix.

| **AFFIX(ES)** | **MEANING**                                                 | **ORIGIN**           |

| ja, cha       | negation, opposite                                          | *ja* - "not"         |
| se, so        | denoting process or state                                   | *sena* - "procedure" |
| on            | denoting a location                                         | *onji* - "place"     |
| pi            | an person/creature/living thing associated with             | *pi* - "three"       |
| lu            | converting a noun or adjective to an adverb                 | *lu* - "to be"       |
| sa, ko        | converting a noun or verb to an adjective; characterised by | *kora* - "often"     |
| kana          | denoting a tool or instrument                               | *kana* - "tool"      |
| vi            | denoting a collection                                       | *vim* - "many"       |
