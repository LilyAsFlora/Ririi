# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī is inflected and phonetically consistent. You can access a dictionary [here](https://github.com/LilyAsFlora/Ririi/blob/master/dict.md).

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. As a Polish speaker, I originally included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) for variety. I removed them later because I decided they sound too harsh for a soft-spoken language.

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system.

|            | Front | Near-front | Central | Near-back | Back  |
|------------|-------|------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Close      | i, i: |            |         |           | u, u: |
| Near-close |       |            |         |           |       |
| Close-mid  |       |            |         |           |       |
| Mid        | e, e: |            |         |           |       |
| Open-mid   |       |            |         |           | o, o: |
| Near-open  |       |            |         |           |       |
| Open       |       |            | a, a:   |           |       |

### Phonotactics

#### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables: **(C)(C)V(C)**, though open syllables are more common.

General constraints:

- Only nasals, unvoiced consonants and non-glottals in codas
- If the first consonant in a complex onset is a nasal, the second cannot be /w/
- Obstruents can only cluster with sonorants
- The first consonant in a complex onset must be an obstruent (e.g. disallowing mra)

#### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of accents to evoke a rhythmic [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). Such a system is useful because it allows singers to freely emphasise syllables that land on strong beats.

## Syntax

### Word Order

Rirī has a de facto word order of SVO (subject-verb-object), but this can change for poetic effect. Possessors and adjectives may come before or after the noun they modify, whereas adpositions and auxiliary verbs precede. 

## Grammar

### Personal Pronouns

Rirī includes the universal first, second, and third person pronouns. Notice the distinction between plural and singular _they_. _Emi_ is used in reference to groups with one or more masculine entities. _Emai_ is used in reference to groups of strictly feminine entities. In unclear or non-binary cases, _amī_ may be used.

#### Singular

| Person | Subject                  | Object                        |   
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | _sa_ — I                 | _sām_ — me                    |   
| 2      | _chi_ — you               | _chiam_ — you                   |   
| 3      | _em/ema/ano/ami_ — he/she/it/they | _emam/emām_/anam/amam — him/her/it/they |   

#### Plural

| Person | Subject      | Object         |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| 1      | _sai_ — we   | _saī_ — me   |
| 2      | _cī_ — you   | _cīm_ — you   |
| 3      | _emi (m.) / emai (f.)_ — they | _emiam (m.) / emaiam (f.)_ — them |

### Plurality

Singular nouns are unmarked. Plurals are marked with suffixes -i or -ī, depending on the noun's ending.

- If the noun ends with a consonant, the suffix -i is appended
- If the noun ends with a vowel, the vowel is replaced with the suffix -i
- If the noun ends with -i, it is replaced with the suffix -ī
- If the noun already ends with -ī, it can be left alone. Optionally, plurality can be enforced with an auxiliary word (e.g. an adjective meaning "many").

### Verbs

### OUTDATED SECTION

Rirī includes four tenses: past, present, future, and conditional. All infinitives end with /u/.

|                              |       simple: unmarked       |        continuous: particle _ni_       |          perfect: suffix -e          |   perfect continuous: prefix o-, suffix -e  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|
|        past: suffix -m       |    _sa kronum_ — I waited    |     _sa ni kronum_ — I was waiting    |      _sa kronme_ — I had waited     |      _sa okronme_ — I had been waiting     |
|       present: unmarked      |      _sa kron_ — I wait      m|     _sa ni kron_ — I am waiting      |      _sa krone_ — I have waited     |      _sa okrone_ — I have been waiting     |
|      future: suffix -sh      |  _sa kronush_ — I will wait  |  _sa ni kronshe_ — I will be waiting |  _sa kronshe_ — I will have waited  |  _sa okronshe_ — I will have been waiting  |
| conditional: auxiliary | _sa chū kronu_ — I would wait| _sa chū ni kronu_ — I would be waiting| _sa chū krone_ — I would have waited| _sa chū okrone_ — I would have been waiting |

### Morphology

1. If simply pasting an affix onto a word results in joined vowels, the affix's vowel always replacs the word's vowel. If the word's vowel is long, this vowel is shortened and joined to the affix.

2. If the final syllable of a word and the affix have matching rimes, the affix replaces the syllable. To illustrate: the possessive case of *madora* ("dream") is *madola*, not *madorala*.

### Noun Case

Rirī features three marked cases: possessive, instrumental, and accusative. They are indicated with suffixes. 

|              | Singular | Plural    | Example                                                                     |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Possessive   | n. + -la | n. + -li | Tomla               |
| Instrumental | n. + -chu | n. + -chi | a|
| Accusative   | n. + -am  | n. + -mi | a|


### Personal verb endings

Personal endings are used to inflect verbs by person, allowing omission of subject pronouns.

|                  | Suffix | Example                       |
|------------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| I                | -en      | _Puchen_ — I think             |
| you (s.)         | -esh   | _Puchesh_ — You think        |
| you (pl.)        | -īn  | _Puchīn_ — You think       |
| he/she/they (s.) | -ja    | _Puja_ - He/she/they think |
| they (pl.)       | -ji  | _Puji_ — They think      |
| it               | -o   | _Pucho_ — It thinks        |
| we               | -īr   | _Puchīr_ — We think         |


_Pash**ja** enane; chū mish**ja**e ete riami._ — She's English; she would have loved these flowers.

_Okronum**īm** e tiam._ — We were waiting for you.

### Adjectives

Adjectives take three standard forms: positive, comparative, and superlative. Adjectives must use the ending _-e_ when describing plural nouns. 

| Positive: unmarked            | Comparative: suffix *ē*                 | Superlative: suffix *u*                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| _eli_ — clean   | _elē_ — cleaner     | _elu_ — cleanest      |
| _rīuch_ — talkative | _rīuchhu_ — more talkative | _rīuchshe_ — most talkative |

### Yes-no Questions

To form yes-no questions, particles _chī_, _chou_ and _chao_ may be applied at the beginning of a sentence.  _Chi_ can also be used as "or."

#### Chaī: neutral

_Chaī agresh sām?_ — Do you trust me?

#### Chou: expecting "yes"

_Chou pasho chān?_ — That's true, right?

#### Chao: expecting "no"

_Chao pashuo tomjisushkām?_ — That's not a flamethrower, is it?

### Negation

To negative a sentence, add particle _ja_ (lit. "no") before the verb.

_Em ja sūja amani groam._ — He did not make that noise.

### Conjunctions

Conjunctions work similarly to English, with the addition of distinguishment between exclusive and inclusive.

_X chi Y_ means you may have X or Y or both. 

_Chi X chi Y_ means you can have only either X or Y, not both.

## Orthography
