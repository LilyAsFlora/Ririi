# Rirī

![alt text](https://github.com/LilyAsFlora/Ririi/blob/master/flagproject.png "Rirī flag")

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (artlang) designed for poetry, song, diaries, or other artistic expression. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "floral language".

Rirī is inflected and phonetically consistent. You can access a dictionary [here](https://github.com/LilyAsFlora/Ririi/blob/master/dict.md).

## Phonology

### Consonants

Plosives are never aspirated.

|        Nasal        |     m    |             |     n    |              ||       |         |
|     Tap or flap     |          |             |     ɾ    |              ||       |         |
|      Fricative      |          |      v      |   s, z   |             |ç|       |    h    |
|     Approximant     |          |             |          |       l      ||   w   |         |
|      Affricate      |          |             |          |     t͡ɕ,  d͡ʑ   ||       |         |

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system.

|            | Front | Central | Back  |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Close      | i, i: |         | u, u: |
| Near-close |       |         |       |
| Close-mid  |       |         |       |
| Mid        | e, e: |         |       |
| Open-mid   |       |         | o, o: |
| Near-open  |       |         |       |
| Open       |       | a, a:   |       |

### Phonotactics

#### Syllable Shape

Rirī permits both open and closed syllables in **(C)(H)V(X)** where:

- (H) denotes an approximant or /ɾ/
- (X) denotes nasals, unvoiced consonants and non-glottals

Additionally,

- No obstruent-obstruent or sonorant-sonorant clusters may occur (even across syllables)

#### Stress

Rirī lacks lexical stress. However, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of accents to evoke a rhythmic [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). Such a system is useful because it allows singers to freely emphasise syllables that land on strong beats.

#### Pronunciation

Often, clustered vowels (e.g. /ei/, /ai/) may become diphthongs when spoken quickly. While not strictly defined in Rirī's phonology, this is acceptable.

## Syntax and Grammar

### Word Order

Rirī has the following de facto word orders, though all are non-configurationally malleable for poetic effect.

- Subject - object - verb
- negative - auxiliary - adverb - verb 
- Adjective/demonstrative/numeral/possessor/adposition - noun - relative clause
- Adverb - adjective

### Personal Pronouns

Rirī includes the gender-distinguished first, second, and third person pronouns. Notice the distinction between plural and singular _they_. _Emi_ is used in reference to groups with one or more masculine entities, whereas _emī_ is used in reference to groups of strictly feminine entities. If ambiguous, inanimate or otherwise neuter, _amī_ may be used.

| Person | Singular                  | Plural                        |   
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1      | _sa_ — I                 | _si_ — we                   |   
| 2      | _cha_ — you               | _chi_ — you                   |   
| 3      | _em/ema/ano/ami_ — he/she/it/they | _emi/emī_/ani/amī- — they (m.) / they (f.) /it/they |   

### Plurality

Singular nouns are unmarked, whereas plurals are marked with suffixes *i* or *ī*, depending on the noun's ending:

- If the noun ends with a consonant, append the suffix *i*
- If the noun ends with a vowel, replace the vowel with *i*
- If the noun ends with *i*, lengthen it to *ī*
- If the noun already ends with *ī*, it can be left alone, or optionally enforced with an auxiliary word (e.g. an adjective meaning "many").

### Verbs

Verb conjugation depends on suffixes, particles, and auxiliary verbs. Regular verbs follow this order of conjugaton:

1. Aspect
2. Person
3. Number
4. Tense

#### Number

Singular: (unmarked)

Plural: suffix *e*

#### Person

1st person: (unmarked)

2nd person: suffix *la*

3rd person: suffix *li*

#### Tense

Present: unmarked

Past: suffix *n*

Future: suffix *ta*

#### Aspect

Simple: unmarked

Continuous: particle *li*

Perfect continuous: particle *le*

#### Mood

Indicated by auxiliary verbs.

#### Valency

Causativity can be described with the verb *miku* (to give), with the action that is caused in the infinitive, and the causee in the accusative.

*Cham mikun kronu.* I made you wait.

Passive actions are indicated with the particle *do* (from *dolu*, "to come").

*Han hali.* The wind blows.

*Han do hali.* The wind is blown.

### Noun Case

Rirī features three marked cases: possessive, instrumental, and accusative. They are indicated with suffixes. Note the following:

1. If simply pasting an affix onto a word results in joined vowels, the affix's vowel always replacs the word's vowel. If the word's vowel is long, this vowel is shortened and joined to the affix. 

2. If clustered obstruents or sonorants occur, the affix replaces the noun's consonant.

3. If the final syllable of a word and the suffix either both begin with a sonorant or an obstruent, the suffix replaces the syllable. This also happens if both syllables have matching rimes. To illustrate: the possessive case of *madora* ("dream") is *madola*, not *madorala*. This does not apply to monosyllabic nouns.

4. If the noun ends with two vowels, the affix replaces the final vowel.

In summary, affixes generally take priority.

|              | Singular | Plural    | 
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Possessive   | suffix *la* | suffix *li* |              
| Instrumental | suffix *chu* | suffix *chi* | 
| Accusative   | suffix *am*  | suffix *mi* |

Note that the instrumental case, not accusative, is used for the noun complement of *lu* (to be). 

*Mīchu lu.* I am a girl.

|:---------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|
| adjective | _ga_ — which |  _eto_ — this |  _ano_ — that |    _tōch_ — some   |     _ja_ — no     |     _hās_ — every     |
|   person  |  _ko_ — who  |  _eto_ — this |  _ano_ — that |   _tore_ — someone  |  _jare_ — no-one  |   _hāsi_ — everyone  |
|   thing   | _sō_ — what |  _eto_ — this |  _ano_ — that | _tosō_ — something | _jasō_ — nothing |  _hāsō_ — everything |

|    way    |  _vā_ — how |               |  _vem_ — thus |  _tovā_ — somehow  |                   |                        |
|   reason  |  _nē_ — why |               |               |                      |                   |                        |

### Adjectives

Adjectives are distinct, and agree with nouns in case and number.

||No marked case|Possessive (suf. *a*)|Instrumental (suf. *u*)|Accusative (suf. *e*)|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Sing.|*eli* — clean|*ela* — clean (thing's [...])| *elu* — (using the) clean (thing)|*ele* — (something affects the) clean (thing) |
|Plural (suf. *i*)|*elī* — clean (things)|*elai* — clean (things' [..])|*elui* — (using the) clean (things)|*elei* — (something affects the) clean (things)|

Comparative adjectives can be expressed through reduplication of their first syllable, and superlatives through reduplication of their final syllable.

The clean glasses. *Eli viki.*

The cleaner glasses. *Ēli viki.*

The cleanest glasses. *Elili viki.*

### Yes-no Questions

To form yes-no questions, one can apply the particles _chi_, _chou_ and _chao_ at either end of a sentence.  _Chi_ can also mean "or." These particles are not necessary to form questions, and are more suited for emphasis.

#### **Chi: neutral**

_Chi ani chali sumchi?_ Are those your knives?

#### Chou: expecting "yes"

*Chou ani chali sumchi?* Those are your knives, right?

#### Chao: expecting "no"

*Chao ani chali sumchi?* Those aren't your knives, are they?

### Negation

The particle *ja* (lit. "no") indicates negation.

Ani chali sumchi ja le. *Those are not your knives.*

### Conjunctions

Conjunctions have the addition of distinguishment between exclusive and inclusive.

_X chi Y_ means you may have X or Y or both. 

_Chi X chi Y_ means you can have only either X or Y, not both.

## Musical Features

Rirī provides a set of monosyllabic "rhyme particles" that lack lexical semantics but aid in the evocation of tone, rhythm, consonance and assonance. One can construct these using any of the following consonants, followed by a vowel of the speaker's choosing, and an optional coda.

|Consonant|b p|m n|l r|k g|w|v|s z|ch j|t d|sh|h|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
|Meaning|joy|sorrow|trust|fear|surprise|disgust|anger|anticipation|weakening of meaning|strengthening of meaning|(no mood)|

To illustrate: the particles *da ma* can serve two purposes:
- Evoking sorrow (as indicating by *m*) of a powerful nature (as indicated by *d*),  
- Creating a rhyme with nearby syllables that include *a*

Note that this would hold the same in reverse order (*ma da*).

Such particles can be combined to create more complex meanings. Using *ve* and *tu* together, for example, mixes disgust and anger to create contempt. Placing one at the beginning of a sentence, and one at the end, could imply a change in mood, or that the speaker is ambivalent regarding their feelings. Nevertheless, this tool has most use in song: particles could emphasise certain beats, fill space not taken by other words, and as aforementioned, offer rhyme and alliteration.

## Examples

*Mī-chu cha-li mado-li lu.*  
`girl-INST you-GEN.PL dream-GEN.PL be`  
I am the girl of your dreams.
