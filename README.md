# Rirī

Rirī is a personal [artistic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) (*artlang* for short) designed for art, poetry, song, and diaries. Stemming from "ri", "flower" and "rī", "speech", its name roughly translates to "flower speech" or "flower language".

## Phonology

### Consonants

Aside from the voiced alveolar tap (/ɾ/), all of Rirī's consonants are present in English. This wasn't always the case. Originally, Rirī included retroflex affricates /ʈʂ/ and /ɖʐ/ (alongside retroflex fricative /ʂ/) — I'm familiar with them as a Polish speaker — to add variety from English. I removed them later due to their unaesthetic sounds.
