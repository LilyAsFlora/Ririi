# Rirī Names

A collection of (hypothetical) given names constructed from my favourite Rirī vocabulary. Although the European speaker would perceive the majority as feminine, none of the following are tied to gender.

**Estia** — intelligent, well-crafted, prideful (lit. "work of writing")

**Kōa** — hard-working, persevering; one who awaits their reward (from *kron*, "time")

**Nini** — stimulating, restorating; a rescuer (lit. "village")

**Madora** — illusive, unpredictable (lit. "dream")

**Mōra** — thinking, studious, reasonable (from *mōru*, "to suppose")

**Sona** — soothing, protecting, motherly (lit. "warm")
