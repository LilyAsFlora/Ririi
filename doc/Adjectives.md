# Adjectives

## Adjectives agree with nouns

In Rirī, adjectives are ultimately derived from nouns. As such, they agree in terms of **class** and **case** (but not number), by way of suffixes. Here's a table of them:

|              | SINGULAR | PLURAL |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| GENITIVE     | -ta (da for unnatural nouns)      | -ti (di for unnatural nouns)    |
| INSTRUMENTAL | -u       | -e     |
| ACCUSATIVE   | -a       | -ai    |
| VOCATIVE     |     -    |    -   |

- Similarly to how nouns inflect for case, the only difference between natural and unnatural nouns is in the genitive.
- Observe that adjectives describing nouns in the vocative case are not given any suffixes.



## Levels of intensity

Forming comparisons is trivial in this case.

**To make a comparative adjective:** Reduplicate the first syllable.
**To make a superlative adjective:** Reduplicate the final syllable.

These reduplications must be performed *after* any inflection. **Note that long vowels are dropped.**

- *Eli*. Clean. *Eleli*. Cleaner. *Elili.* Cleanest.
- *Īshkō*. Dangerous. *Ishīshkō*. More dangerous. *Ishkōko*. Most dangerous.
