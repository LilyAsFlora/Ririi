# Phonology

  
Given its purpose as an artlang, Rirī's phonology suits what I consider euphonious, being loosely influenced by Latin and Japanese. As a Polish speaker, the consonant set originally included both retroflex affricates and fricatives, before I decided they sound too harsh for a soft-spoken language. Thus, delicate consonants like /l/, /ɾ/, nasals, and close/mid vowels tend to appear most frequently in the lexicon, particularly in comparison to voiced plosives. Consonants are never aspirated.

### Consonants

|                     | Bilabial | Labiodental | Alveolar | Postalveolar |Palatal| Velar | Glottal |
|:-------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:------------:|:-:|:-----:|:-------:|
|       Plosive       |   p, b   |             |   t, d   |              ||  k, g |         |
|        Nasal        |     m    |             |     n    |              ||       |         |
|     Tap or flap     |          |             |     ɾ    |              ||       |         |
|      Fricative      |          |      v      |   s, z   |             |ç|       |    h    |
|     Approximant     |          |             |          |       l      ||   w   |         |
|      Affricate      |          |             |          |     t͡ɕ,  d͡ʑ   ||       |         |

### Vowels

Rirī features the typical five-vowel system. There's really no need for anything complex here. I attribute the frequent difficulty in understanding English vocals to the barrage of different vowel sounds that are available. Perhaps this phonology can make lyrics somewhat easier to discern, if only a little.

|            | Front | Central | Back  |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Close      | i, i: |         | u, u: |
| Mid        | e, e: |         |       |
| Open       |       | a, a:   | ɒ, ɒ: |

Key points:

- /e/ is the open-mid front unrounded vowel [ɛ]
- /u/ is the close back unrounded vowel [ɯ]
