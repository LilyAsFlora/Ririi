# Nouns

## Naturality and Unnaturality

If you're familiar with any one of a decent number of European languages, you're likely familiar with the concept of grammatical gender — i.e. whether something is "masculine" or "feminine". Rirī makes a similar distinction, but rather than using a sexual basis, we (somewhat poetically) distinguish whether a noun is **natural** or **unnatural**.

Some examples of natural nouns include:
- Biological organisms (humans, animals, plants, cells) and their qualities (sex, health, fitness, age)
- Celestial objects (stars, planets, moons, galaxies)
- Elements and other natural phenomena (earth, air, water, fire, wind, ice, gold, hydrogen)
- Geographic features (mountains, plateaus, deserts, caves, jungles, islands)
- Emotions (sadness, joy, anger, loneliness)
- Time (past, present, future)
- Intellect (knowledge, wisdom, understanding, curiosity)

Some examples of unnatural nouns include:
- Man-made constructs (buildings, cars, computers, books, clothes, fences)
- Human relationships (community, family, friendship)
- Human ideas (mathematics, logic, philosophy, sarcasm, opinions, countries)
- Language and communication (words, phrases, languages)
- Creativity (art, music, literature)
- Ethics (morality, justice, peace, status, law)
- Identity (gender, names, race, ethnicity)

As a rule of thumb, most **natural** nouns end in the vowel *a*, while unnatural nouns end with anything else (although this is not a strict guideline). Otherwise, perhaps try asking yourself, *Can a dog understand it?* If so, it's probably natural. If you're unsure whether a noun is natural or unnatural, the dictionary will tell you.

## One, or many?

Nouns can be singular or plural, without depending on class.

**To make a noun plural:** Apply the suffix *i*.
- *Doha*. Ocean. *Dohi.* Oceans.
- *Nem.* Video. *Nemi.* Videos.
- *Ri.* Flower. *Rī.* Flowers.

If the noun already ends in *ī*, you cannot mark plurality, and it must be interpreted from context. Otherwise, you can enforce plurality with a quantifying adjective, such as "three".

## Case

Rirī has **four** [noun cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case), distinguished by suffixes. These are the **genitive**, **instrumental**, **accusative** and **vocative**. Here's a table of these suffixes:

|              | SINGULAR | PLURAL  |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| GENITIVE     | *ka* (*ga* for unnatural nouns)  | *ki* (*gi* for unnatural nouns) |
| INSTRUMENTAL | *un*   | *en*  |
| ACCUSATIVE   | *a*    | *i*    |
| VOCATIVE     | *e*    | *ei*  |

The only difference between natural and unnatural nouns is that in the genitive case, the suffix applies to unnatural nouns is *ga* and *gi* respectively instead.

### Things to be aware of

- The complement of *lu*, "to be", goes in the instrumental case.
