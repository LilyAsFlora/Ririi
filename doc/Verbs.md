# Verbs

Verbs are one of the more complex aspects of Rirī's grammar, as they inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and person.

## Understanding verbs

Every verb in Rirī ends in a consonant followed by [u]. Here are some examples:

- *mōru* — to think, suppose
- *namu* — to hide, conceal (oneself)
- *sonu* — to comfort, soothe

It's important to note that the **root** of the verb does not include this final syllable. In other words, the roots of *mōru*, *namu* and *sonu* are *mō*, *na* and *so* respectively.

### What about monosyllabic verbs?

The roots of monosyllabic verbs are irregular, so here's a list of them. Fortunately, there isn't many!

| **Verb** | **Root** | **Verb meaning**                 |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------|
| lu       | la       | to be, exist                |
| lū       | lu       | to wet, moisten, dampen     |
| mu       | mei      | to remember, recall         |
| nu       | nu       | to know, be aware of        |
|  pu      | pana     | to run, sprint              |
| wu       | wei      | to see, view, discern       |
| ju       | jana     | to dim, dark, obscure       |
| shu      | shai     | to develop, work on, refine |

### What about identical roots?

Certain verbs, like *cholu* (to arrive) and *chosu* (to understand) have the same root: *cho*. Consequently, figuring out which is which in their conjugated forms is left entirely up to context. 

## Conjugating for Tense

Rirī distinguishes the distant past, past, present, future, and distant future as tenses.

### The present
The present is simply indicated using the dictionary form (including the aforementioned [u] syllable).

### The past

Take the root of the verb and append the suffix *na* (from *kana*, "instrument").

- *Mōna*. Thought.
- *Nana*. Hid.
- *Sona*. Soothed.

### The future

Take the root of  the verb and append the suffix *de* ("towards").

- *Mōde*. Will think.
- *Nade*. Will hide.
- *Sode.* Will soothe.

### Distance

The distant past and future can be created by reduplicating the above suffixes.

- *Monana*. Thought (a long time ago). *Modede*. Will think (in a long while).
- *Nanana*. Hid (a long time ago). *Nadede*. Will hide (in a long while).
- *Sonana*. Soothed (a long time ago). *Sodede*. Will soothe (in a long while).

## Conjugating for person

On top of tense, verbs in Rirī distinguish between first, second, and third person using infixes.

### First person
This is the default implication. No conjugation here.

### Second person

Add the infix *shi* after the root of the verb (from *chi*, "you").

- *Moshiru.* You think.
- *Nashiru*. You hide.
- *Soshiru*. You soothe.

### Third person

Add the infix *me* after the root of the verb (from *emi*, "they").

- *Momeru*. They think.
- *Nameru*. They hide.
- *Someru*. They soothe.
