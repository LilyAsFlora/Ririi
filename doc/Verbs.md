# Verbs

Verbs are one of the more nuanced aspects of Rirī's grammar.

## Understanding verbs

Every verb in Rirī ends in a consonant followed by [u]. Here are some examples:

- *mōru* — to think, suppose
- *namu* — to hide, conceal (oneself)
- *sonu* — to comfort, soothe

It's important to note that the **root** of the verb does not include this final syllable. In other words, the roots of *mōru*, *namu* and *sonu* are *mō*, *na* and *so* respectively.

### What about monosyllabic verbs?

The roots of monosyllabic verbs are irregular, so here's a list of them. Fortunately, there isn't many!

| **Verb** | **Root** | **Verb meaning**                 |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------|
| lu       | la       | to be, exist                |
| lū       | lu       | to wet, moisten, dampen     |
| mu       | mei      | to remember, recall         |
| nu       | nu       | to know, be aware of        |
|  pu      | pana     | to run, sprint              |
| wu       | wei      | to see, view, discern       |
| ju       | jana     | to dim, dark, obscure       |
| shu      | shai     | to develop, work on, refine |

### What about identical roots?

Certain verbs, like *cholu* (to arrive) and *chosu* (to understand) have the same root: *cho*. Consequently, figuring out which is which in their conjugated forms is left entirely up to context. 

## Conjugating for person

Verbs in Rirī distinguish between first, second, and third person using infixes. In other words, instead of saying "he said" or "she said", these pronouns are baked in to the verbs themselves.

**First person** — This is the default implication, so a conjugation isn't needed.

**Second person** — Insert *chi* after the verb root.

**Third person** — Insert *me* after the verb root.

- *Mōchiru.* You think.
- *Namemu*. They hide.
- *Somenu*. They soothe.

## Tense and aspect

Perhaps surprisingly, Rirī has three main tenses, as commonly thought of in English: past, present, and future.
The addition of **distant** past and **distant** future implicates "long, long ago [...]" or "very far in the future from now, [...]". 

- The future and distant future tenses are not typically used. Instead, the plain present tense usually takes the place of the future. It follows that explicitly using the future tense creates a somewhat pedantic and scholarly tone.

To create the **past** tense, replace the final /u/ with /a/.

To create the **future** tense, replace the final /u/ with /i/.

Present tense is the default meaning, so a conjugation isn't needed.

Now, to create the **distant past/future**, lengthen the final vowel in the verb.

- *Mōra*. I thought.
- *Nami*. Will hide.
- *Sonā*. I soothed (a long time ago).

### Aspect

As is the case in many Slavic languages, Rirī distinguishes the perfective and imperfective aspect. Here's the roles they play in Rirī:

- The **perfective** aspect indicates a simple event that has been accomplished.
- The **imperfective** aspect indicates a repeated, ongoing, or otherwise incomplete action.

The perfective aspect is unmarked.

To indicate the imperfective aspect, append the suffix *e*.

- *Mōrae*. I was thinking. *Mōrue*. I am thinking. *Mōrie*. I will be thinking.
- *Namae*. I was hiding. *Namue.* I am hiding. *Namie*. I will be hiding.
- *Sonae*. I was soothing. *Sonue*. I am soothing. *Sonie*. I will be soothing.

## Expressing attitudes towards an action
 Rirī indicates mood using auxiliary verbs. These moods can suggest the speaker's attitude towards an action. 

| **Auxiliary (English)** | **Auxiliary (Rirī)** | **Meaning: This action is...**            |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| to see                  | vidu                 | dependent on another event                |
| to think                | mōru                 | a suggestion; a good idea; morally right  |
| to say                  | riu                  | a requirement; must be accomplished |
| to know                 | nu                   | a question; is this the case?             |
| to wait                 | kronu                | something that might happen               |

### Examples, with the verb *sūtu* (to stop)

- ***Vidu** sūtu.* I would stop. (lit. "I see I stop")
- ***Mōru** sūtu.* I should stop. (lit. "I think I stop")
- ***Riu** sūtu.* I must stop. (lit. "I say I stop")
- ***Nu** sūtu.* I stop? (lit. "I know I stop")
- ***Kronu** sūtu.* I might stop. (lit. "I wait I stop")

### Negation

There is a nuance between negation of moods and the actions themselves. For example, you can differentiate "I can't go" in two ways:

- As "I can (not go)", meaning you are capable of not going.
- As "I cannot (go)", meaning you are not capable of going.

**To negate moods** — Add *ja* ("no"/"not") before the auxiliary verb.
**To negate verbs** — Add *ja* before the verb itself.

### Perspective

There is also a nuance in how these auxiliary verbs are conjugated. Let's look at this example:

*Sūmeti.* She will stop.

If instead you wish to ask, "Will she stop?" You must be careful. You can conjugate auxiliary verbs for person to indicate the *perspective* of the attitude that you're conveying. Look at the following examples:

1. *Nu sūmeti?* Will she stop?
2. *Nume sūmeti?* Will she stop?
3. *Nuchi sūmeti?* Will she stop?

While all of these share the same elementary meaning, there are slight differences between them.

- In the first case, *nu* is not conjugated for person, thereby implicating first person. This carries the additional meaning that *you*, specifically, are questioning whether she will stop. 

- Likewise, in the second case, *nu* is conjugated for the third person. This might mean that you're questioning whether she *herself* intends to stop, or if some other third party thinks she will stop. 

- Finally, in the third case, *nu* is conjugated for the second person. This might mean that you're questioning whether the person you're addressing thinks she will stop.

Essentially, you can conjugate these auxiliary verbs to shift the perspective of attitude.
