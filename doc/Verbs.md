# Verbs

Verbs are one of the more complex aspects of Rirī's grammar, as they inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and person.

## Understanding verbs

Every verb in Rirī ends in a consonant followed by [u]. Here are some examples:

- *mōru* — to think, suppose
- *namu* — to hide, conceal (oneself)
- *sonu* — to comfort, soothe

It's important to note that the **root** of the verb does not include this final syllable. In other words, the roots of *mōru*, *namu* and *sonu* are *mō*, *na* and *so* respectively.

### What about monosyllabic verbs?

The roots of monosyllabic verbs are irregular, so here's a list of them. Fortunately, there isn't many!

| **Verb** | **Root** | **Verb meaning**                 |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------|
| lu       | la       | to be, exist                |
| lū       | lu       | to wet, moisten, dampen     |
| mu       | mei      | to remember, recall         |
| nu       | nu       | to know, be aware of        |
|  pu      | pana     | to run, sprint              |
| wu       | wei      | to see, view, discern       |
| ju       | jana     | to dim, dark, obscure       |
| shu      | shai     | to develop, work on, refine |
