# Verbs
Verbs are one of the more complex aspects of Rirī's grammar, as they inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and person.

## Understanding verbs

Every verb in Rirī ends in a consonant followed by [u]. Here are some examples:

- *mōru* — to think, suppose
- *namu* — to hide, conceal (oneself)
- *pu* — to run, sprint

  It's important to note that the **stem** of the verb does not include this final syllable.
