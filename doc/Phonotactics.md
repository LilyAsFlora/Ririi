# Phonotactics

## Syllable Shape

Rirī permits open and closed syllables according to the scheme **(C)(H)V(X)**, where:

- **C** denotes any consonant
- **H** denotes an approximant or a liquid
- **V** denotes any vowel
- **X** denotes nasals and unvoiced consonants, excluding /h/

Additionally,

- No obstruent-obstruent clusters may occur (even across syllables).

## Stress

Rirī lacks a strict lexical stress. Instead, in poetry or song, speakers may wish to apply patterns of accents to evoke a rhythmic [meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre_(poetry)). Such a system allows singers to freely emphasise syllables that land on strong beats, without needing to choose words that do.

### An example

Consider singing the phrase *e mona kishi do* in a quadruple meter (this phrase is gibberish, but it works as an example). The beats might on the following syllables:

```
e mo - na ki - shi do
^ ^       ^        ^
```

With this system, the singer can simply accent "e", "mo", "ki" and "do" without needing to change the words at all. Convenient, isn't it?
